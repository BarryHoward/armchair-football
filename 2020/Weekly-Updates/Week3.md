# Power Rankings

Author: Barry (The Art of the Deal)

Never has my excitement for a football season been so quickly drowned in a baththub of my own tears.  If this season continues on this path, these power rankings will soon be classified as hate speech.  But I'm mostly good for now.  In honor of our new overlord, please enjoy these Star Wars themed power rankings...

## Sith Lord

### 1 - BabyYodaFanClub

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -- | 3-0-0 | 456.08 | 320.59 | 152.03 | 106.86 | 3-0-0 | 152.03 | 106.86 |

> Will being backed into a corner finally unleash the fabled Zen Jen...

"Judge me by my size, do you?!?" Jen bellowed down at the league from the top of the standings.  Off to the best start in league history, Zen Jen's never got the chance to panic trade her fantastic team away, as she started the season 3-0 with a massive 150+ points per week.  Now facing the horrifying prospect of dealing with a day 1 super team, the rest of league can only cower in fear at Jen's dark side, as she mockingly abuses her waiting victims with the help of Darth Roethlisberger.  Imagine a world in which Yoda was a Sith Lord, and you will have dreamed up the world we now live in -- truly the darkest timeline.  She now faces two of the weakest teams in the league before likely entering a showdown at 5-0 with challenger Danielle.  Let the hate flow...

## Jedi Master

### 2 - Mrs. OBJ

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

> This year her roster might even be better...

The clear frontrunner in any other year, Danielle's great start is obviously overshadowed by Jen's spiteful bludgeoning, but very impressive nonetheless.  What differentiates this team from last years is that she isn't just scraping by.  Her team has been a model of consistency, putting up 130+ every week thanks to Josh Allen having a breakout year and her WRs covering her deficiencies at RB2.  She has a tough matchup with Joe, but she would be forgiven for looking ahead to her showdown with Jen, which will likely determine first place for the first half of the season.  Last year's villain, Danielle may play hero this time around, as she has set herself up as maybe the only challenge to Jen's dominance.

## Jedi Knights

### 3 - Mo ScreenZ Mo YardZ

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

> After creepily lurking for three years, 3Screenz has entered into the drama-filled foray of GE fantasy football...

Things get a bit more ambiguous outside of the top two, as 3Screenz takes the third spot, but his grasp on it is a bit tenuous.  Two strong weeks have dispatched two league veterans, but a closer look at his scores will show that this is mostly the Russell Wilson 5TDs per game show.  There's some definite vulnerability on this squad, but for now he's got a pretty strong point lead on the rest of the middle pack.  But seeing how he's not even favored against Jeff next week, I wouldn't count on him holding onto this position for too much longer.  Better take some screenZshots, Michael.

### 4 - noLuck

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)

> Joe has about as much depth as an instagram model playing with her cat...

I said Joe would have issues if he had any injuries, and naturally he has had no injuries.  A weak bench doesn't seem to matter if you've got Luck on your side, and since Andrew Luck is long retired, Joe went ahead and drafted lady luck without us noticing.  Another example of a team performing well with some liability, Joe is going to need to lean heavily on his good fortune, as he matches up with powerhouse Danielle this week.  An upset here could really cement his team as contender to go home with more money this year.

### 5 - Eagle Eye

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -- | 1-2-0 | 358.12 | 396.29 | 119.37 | 132.1 | 1-2-0 | 119.37 | 132.1 |

> If any of his starting lineup falters, which is quite likely, his season will look as sad as an Eagle with a clipped wing, hobbling around too weak to defend itself until it dies alone in the forest...

It's been a tale of two seasons this year for Anthony.  On the one hand, he's been incredibly fortunate with injuries.  On the other, he's had by far the most points scored against him, leading to a deceptive 1-2 record.  Anthony is putting up the points this year, and since the Eagles might need to recruit Mark Wahlberg to play WR for the next few weeks, Ertz's targets are probably about to explode.  He also somehow managed to guess which RB the 49ers were gonna give the ball to -- not an easy feat.  I expect that his record will improve soon, especially if my busted-ass squad can't find a way to put up some points this week.

## Padawans

### 6 - Haters Gonna Hate

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)

> If AJ Green doesn't return to form, he will need to keep a very close eye on the waiver market the first couple weeks hoping to snag an early season breakout...

So far this has been a pretty middling year for Jonathan.  As predicted, he has struggled getting points at WR, but "help" is on the way in the form of OBJ.  What would have been a blockbuster steal a few weeks ago, might end up being an underwhelming acquisition given the current state of the Browns offense.  Jonathan is betting otherwise, and if he's right, he could quickly rise out of the middle of the pack.  If not, he's still going to have 2 empty spots at WR, which means he won't exactly be formidable.  In Jedi terms, that means he ends up getting shot in the back by some random stormtroopers.  Such is the fate for many of us in Jen's new empire.  A pretty even matchup with Ben this week should shed some more light on Jonathan's prospects.

### 7 - Tua Legit to Quit

> Jack is looking to once again escape the middle of the pack this year...

In a similar situation to Jonathan, Jack's team has some pieces to build upon, but he has a pretty glaring weakness at RB.  This unbalanced squad has led Jack to some serviceable performances, but the gravity of pack has a firm hold on him right now, no matter how hard he tries to escape it.  Even in the best case scenario, Jack will need a 3rd RB.  Worst case scenario, one of his 2 RBs get hurt and he spends the rest of the year getting RB scraps from the waiver wire.  Fortune has held so far for Jack, including a matchup this week with bottom-dweller Alex, but after what will probably be a 3-1 start, Jack will have problems keeping up if he doesn't keep looking for help at the position.

> Barry ended up with a 3-headed tandem of high-upside (though somewhat high risk) backs...

As any of you who saw the debate last night may have gathered, Trump is clearly a Falcons fan, because nothing else could explain that level of reckless agitation and rage.  Unlike last season, however, my fantasy performance is only compounding my sad acceptance of the clown show that is my home football team.  Fantasy wise, I'm only second in injuries to Dan, having to watch as my WR1, TE1, and RB3 go down for multiple games.  In my experience, there is no such thing as luck, but I'm beginning to question that world view, as this stupid gambling ring is testing my patience.  My team still has some promise, but thanks to the Falcons, I'm one dead Natalie Portman away from choking some younglings.

### 9 - melons are gourds

|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

> The Lions are bad, melons are gourds, and Ben is unpredictable...

Ben hasn't exactly been lighting up the scoreboard, but he chose his moments wisely, as he is now sitting at 2-1 after beating up on two injury-depleted teams and looking as non-threating as possible in his matchup with Jen.  Is his team that threatening?  No.  But he's off to good start record wise, and Gronk has decided that he actually wants to play football, so his TE situation may not be as dire as it once seemed.  Ben should remain in the middle of the pack, but the coronavirus situation has clearly dulled his penchant for unexpected moves.  Hopefully that will change, as the league could use a bit of humor in these dark times.

> I will not be making the mistake of overestimating Jeff's team again -- also because his team doesn't look as good...

Welp, Jeff made the very shrewd move of trading all of last year's injuries for just one injury.  But as the monkey paw curled, it was revealed that said injury was CMC himself.  "This is fine", Jeff said as he handled it in a typical Jeff fashion by spending $60 wavier bucks on a backup RB and trading away Odell.  Really startling when you type it out like that, but here we are.  The Star Wars comparison would be when Anakin chokes Padme to save Padme, but really it's just Jeorf being Jeorf.  He has a much better chance of avoiding the toilet bowl this year, but until CMC is back, there's a good chance he loses matchups like this week's with Michael.  Given my own situation, however, I have no pity to spare for him this year.

### 11 - Matt's Team

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)

> Matt began to draft a below average team in my estimation...

"Never tell me the odds", Matt whispered to himself as he blasted ridiculous trade after ridiculous trade out to the league.  Can't really blame him though, as it will take a few one-sided exchanges to get him into contention.  On the bright side, Chubb has essentially become the Cleveland offense, and Burrow has been a pretty solid rookie QB, so Matt seems to also be safe from falling into toilet contention.  Unfortunately, he's very likely to be choked through his computer screen by Darth Strollo this week, especially if Julio can't play at 100% (falcons fan inside tip:  he won't).  I would also suggest starting Lazard against the Falcons this week, as their lack of pass defense is quite disturbing.

> Perhaps it's not healthy to delve too deeply into the mind of Suciu...

People handle grief in all sorts of ways.  Jeff handled it last year with a weirdly endearing form of nihilism.  Dan just seems to be pissed.  Losing one's WR1, TE1, RB3, etc to injuries is enough to turn anyone's eyes yellow, so I can forgive both Dan's recent demeanor and his place in the standings.  Luckily, Thomas and Kittle should be back this week or the next, and if they aren't back this week, he has the solace of matching up against Frank -- one of the few teams he has a chance against short-handed.  If he can hold out and get to a 2-2 record, a healthy squad could lead to him making a push down the stretch, but another loss could mean he's in toilet bowl contention.  The duel of dookies this week could have some surprising relevance.

## Younglings

### 13 - Team Purple Reign

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)

> There's a fine line between forging your own path and marching off a cliff...

I, for one, would like to thank Frank for diving head first into the fantasy waters, because this clearly hasn't been the start that a rookie would have hoped for.  As expected, Frank's team has struggled to keep up with veteran squads, and the one time they did perform, they fell victim to Danielle's voodoo, leaving Frank in a 2-way competition for the toilet bowl with Alex.  Hopefully Alex can give him some pointers on how to pull out of a nosedive if she's not too busy hoarding them all for herself.

> But if I were a betting man (and 40 dollars says I am), if she starts the season 0-3, I don't see this team carrying her back to the top again...

Moment of truth, Barry.  Are you man of science or a man of faith?  Because the very probable has now happened, and Alex has again started a season 0-3.  The man of science in me is saying that this is very bad for Alex.  The man of faith in me is saying "It better not happen again".  Alex once again finds herself in a familiar position, but every logical bone in my body says it's different this time.  Even if Lamar goes back to putting up 40 pts a game, there's nobody else on this roster capable of helping him carry her back to the top.  Instead I'm starting to wonder if this will be the first time a League Champion wins the toilet bowl in the following season, though i volunteer to pay for shipping to Boston if that's the case.
