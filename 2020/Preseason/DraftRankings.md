# Draft Rankings

Due to my great success last year in predicting the preseason champion with facts and logic, I once again present to you a vision of the future that is sure to age like an albino in a tanning bed.  Please deposit all salt in the nearest ocean.

## Tier 1 -- Championship Contenders

Barry's team and early round picks falling into his lap... name a more iconic duo.  With the 12th and 17th picks in the draft, Barry was able to nab the 8th and 9th ranked players respectively, giving him a legitimate RB1 and WR1 combo.  Once again going with a RB-depth strategy, Barry ended up with a 3-headed tandem of high-upside (though somewhat high risk) backs, a serviceable WR2 and Matty Ice in an even year.  Combine that with a pick at TE that is only a sleeper if you're heavily sedated, and Barry has once again drafted a well-rounded team with a solid bench to hopefully absorb some covid-related issues.  Of course, Barry is always looking to improve through intense negotiation, but this may be the first time he goes into the season without a glaring gap in his lineup.  He faces off against Alex in week one, but at this point, his most pressing concern might be finding a new team name barring the outcome of the November election.

Determined to improve upon her past drafts, Jen spent the week doing mock drafts, and while her actual draft didn't turn out quite as planned, Jen ended up with a good squad.  Three solid WRs and two top tier RBs are supported by a solid TE and some depth at each position.  Her only real concern is the Paragon of Pittsburgh himself, Big Ben.  With no QB backup, Ben and Jen are stuck with each other for the forseeable future, and with one of them ageing out of football and the other drinking out of sobriety, Bennifer may end up being a short-lived partnership if Ben doesn't get off to a fast start.  This, of course, leads me to a pretty safe prediction that Jen will make an ill-advised trade for a middling QB early in the season.  The questions then become "How much will she sacrifice?" and "Who will benefit?"  Only time will tell.  It's a shame, because otherwise this is a contending team that will inevitably come crashing down due to micromanaging and spite.  Jen gonna Jen.

Last year's third place finisher and points champion has once again drafted a formidable team that could keep him in contention the whole year.  Showcasing quite possibly the best starting lineup in the league, Joe once again has a scary RB duo and a very good WR duo.  Also thanks to bargain bin gets like Carson Wentz and Jared Cook, there really are no weak spots in his first string.  Unfortunately, his bench is a different story.  During a pandemic, depth will almost certain be important, and Joe has about as much depth as an instagram model playing with her cat.  Joe has once again quietly put together a solid draft, but he'll need to do some work on the waiver wire if he doesn't want to start tanking when the BYE weeks start.

## Tier 2 -- Middle Men

4 - **TompaBaeGronkaneers**

Due to to his disappointing turn as last year's preseason champion, I will not be making the mistake of overestimating Jeff's team again -- also because his team doesn't look as good.  Jeff's draft started out on track when he was essentially forced by fate to forgo a first round QB in order to nab the team-carrier himself, CMC.  Then he went about getting a solid WR... and then another... and then another.  Before you knew it, Jeff had 6 WRs and J.K. Dobbins as his RB2.  Combine that with not having a backup QB for the 41 yr old Drew Brees, and Jeff might have one of the most lopsided teams that a veteran has ever fielded in this league.  Despite starting off the season in familiar fashion by having his kicker cut over the weekend, Yahoo is once again claiming he had the best draft, which should be a great comfort to anyone afraid of a robot uprising.  Jeff has some of work to do if wants this team to be more than CMC and WR bunch, but at least he doesn't have to worry about the preseason champion curse this year.

5 - **danny pennies**

Of all the speculation going into this year's draft, none was as fevered as Minshew Mania, and Dan didn't disappoint by picking up Gardner in round 7 to avoid having to pay a king's ransom for his mustachioed man crush.  Unfortunately, choosing a meme as his starting QB means I have to give Dan a QB grade of 'D' for 'dad bod'.  Hidden in all this QB absurdity, though, is that Dan has drafted a very good team around him.  A deep corp of WRs and a serviceable stable or RBs should keep Dan in contention regardless of whether meme magic strikes or not, and while he is missing a backup for top-end TE Kittle, his DEF and K are also formidable.  Having poured over his roster, I must ask if the Minshew whispers were just a bit of fun or a clever bit of misdirection that allowed Dan to grab a bargain bin QB and load up at all the other positions.  I also can't help but notice that his WR2 and his WR3 are on the bench, so I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that they are still the planned starters.  Perhaps it's not healthy to delve too deeply into the mind of Suciu, but I expect Dan to improve upon his disappointing 11th place finish last season.

6 - **Haters Gonna Hate**

The commissioner may have left GE, but he chose to stick with the league in the hopes of finally securing a championship, and so far, I'd say he's off to an adequate start.  Another believer in the "Baby got Backs" school of drafting, veteran Jonathan was able to secure a solid trio of RBs considering his early round snag of Kelse.  So while his TE and RB positions are mostly set, his WRs took a major hit, as Hollywood Brown is his WR1, and it only falls off from there.  If AJ Green doesn't return to form, he will need to keep a very close eye on the waiver market the first couple weeks hoping to snag an early season breakout.  A trade may also be an option, but that might be tough to pull off without an in-office presence.  However, Jonathan likes to think of himself as the hero of the league, so he will no doubt use this slight disadvantage and the subsequent disrespect as further motivation to get the moves he needs done.  Undoubtedly he will be active early, and if he can pull off a move, a decent team could become dangerous real quick.

7 - **melons are gourds**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |

The Lions are bad, melons are gourds, and Ben is unpredictable.  Some things are just facts of life, but this year started bit differently, as Ben mostly drafted by the book and ended up with a middle of the pack team because of it -- a huge improvement from his draft last year.  While this may not seem impressive on its own, league veterans will recall that Ben bamboozled multiple players out of high-tier talent last year.  So, given his track record, starting an adequate team means Ben should end up near the top by season's end.  2 solid WRs and 2 solid RBs should anchor his squad as he hopes his homer pick of Matt Stafford and his prayer pick of Gronk pan out.  If they somehow do, Ben could move up the rankings quickly, which would be a massive improvement on his near toilet bowl finish from last season.  With the Lions predicted to improve over last year, that just leaves the melons as the last ones refusing to embrace change.

8 - **Tua Legit to Quit**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
| B+ | A  | C+ | B- |   A   |

Just barely missing the playoffs last year, Jack is looking to once again escape the middle of the pack this year... but probably won't with the uneven squad he has drafted.  Again grabbing top-tier QB Deshaun Watson, Jack then proceeded to draft every WR available leaving him with just 3 RBs, only one of which is a bona fide starter.  His top 3 WRs are solid, but unless Michael Thomas is catching 10 slant passes for you a game, WRs are great way to achieve inconsistent scoring, something Jack knows quite a lot about at this point.  Not having impressive backups for QB and TE might also hurt Jack as the season progresses.  He does have pieces to move, however, so while some managers can afford to stand pat with their drafted teams, Tua Legit to Quit better not quit until he gets some legit positional depth.

9 - **Mrs. OBJ**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
| B  | B+ | B+ |  C |   B-  |

The front-runner for most of 2019, Mrs. OBJ was able to win some close games despite a somewhat underwhelming roster.  This year her roster might even be better, fielding 2 top-tier RBs and 2 top-tier WRs.  Neither of which is OBJ, however, which means that even family members have little faith in the Cleveland offense.  The rest of her team could use some work, however, as she is weak at TE and doesn't have the depth to reliably fill her FLEX position.  While this makes an adequate roster, unless her good fortune continues into 2020, I don't see her repeating her upstart performance from last year.  That being said, this has the makings of a playoff team, and an addition or two could again mean that Danielle is once again managing the team that everyone is chasing.

10 - **Mo ScreenZ Mo YardZ**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|

After creepily lurking for three years, 3Screenz has entered into the drama-filled foray of GE fantasy football.  Some of you might have noticed the clever football pun in his name, but based off his initial draft, I'm not sure it was intentional.  Adequate at QB, RB and TE but noticeably weak at WR and FLEX, Michael will have to dive head first into the choppy trade waters soon if he wants to make up for a lack of positional depth before he falls behind the pack.  On the one hand, it's a chance to fulfill a lifelong dream of yelling at people over pretend sports.  On the other hand, it comes with the stress of having the entire team slowly grow to distrust you.  While somewhat stumbling out of the gate, I expect Michael to adapt quickly but probably not enough to make the playoffs.

11 - **Eagle Eye**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|

Adjusting his strategy from last year, Anthony only took one Eagles player (plus their defense), and that was Ertz during a contract dispute.  He'll probably play, but Anthony is taking no chances, having drafted three TEs.  The rest of his team is what he should be worried about, however, as drafting a QB in the 1st and a TE in the 3rd has left Anthony pretty light at WR and RB.  While not as hopeless as last season's draft, Anthony needs to desperately improve at both positions, so that he isn't stuck looking to his barren bench.  3 TEs, and 2 Defenses means that roster space is at a premium, and he could use the depth right now.  If any of his starting lineup falters, which is quite likely, his season will look as sad as an Eagle with a clipped wing, hobbling around too weak to defend itself until it dies alone in the forest.  Hopefully the picks he invested in K and DEF can keep his team viable until help arrives, but there's no way they will carry him two seasons in a row.

## Tier 3 -- Toilet Teeterers

12 - **Matt's Team**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
| C  | A- | B  | C  |   A+  |

Every year this league's draft produces its fair share of drama, but none has been quite like Matt's registration issues persisting 10 minutes before the start of the draft itself.  Once the draft actually started, though, Matt began to draft a below average team in my estimation.  Gordon and Swift are concerns at RB and he is outright weak at QB and TE, so Matt will need to lean on his WR 1/2 to keep up with more well-balanced offenses.  But as the league's biggest wild card, it's possible that the league rookie, fantasy vet knows something the rest of the league doesn't.  I, however, think the pre-draft drama either rattled him or kept him from implementing any sort of strategy.  He will need to be more active in the league going forward if he wants to stay in contention and out of toilet bowl range.

13 - **A1 Since Day 1**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|

I will not be making the same mistake as last year when I graded Alex's draft the worst in the league.  Instead I will be grading it second to last, so as not to temp fate, but believe me, this isn't spite.  Her RBs are a mess, and her WRs after Godwin and Chark are also not going to be able to fill her flex spot reliably.  As with last year, she is banking on two teammates to carry her, but I can't see how a team with RBs this bad can consistently win games.  I can't help but predict that just like Beyonce, her time at the top is probably over.  Who knows, though?  I may end up eating those words, as her opening matchup is against my team, which I have again graded very highly.  But if I were a betting man (and 40 dollars says I am), if she starts the season 0-3, I don't see this team carrying her back to the top again.  Repeating is tough work, as I believe the supremely confident Alex may soon find out.

14 - **F's Dandy Team**

| QB | WR | RB | TE | DEF/K |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-----:|
| A  | C  | D+ |  B |   B-  |

There's a fine line between forging your own path and marching off a cliff, and Frank may have crossed that line during the draft of his inaugural season.  With questionable pick after questionable pick, Frank soon ended up receiving advice from the entire league on how to get his draft back on track.  By the end, most of the league and the yahoo algorithm were forced to concur that the first-timer would almost certainly not be repeating Alex's success from last year.  His team could best be described as two elite QBs and some bench players, so a trade will almost certainly be necessary at some point.  On the one hand, if Frank somehow becomes league champion this year, he could start his own religion based solely on his ability to see the future.  More likely, however, he will be praying that someone else has an equally disastrous season just to keep the toilet bowl off his desk.
