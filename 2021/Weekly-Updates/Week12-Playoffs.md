# Odds

Below I have broken down the odds as calculated for each prize up for grabs (Points Championship, Pity Prize, Playoffs, and the illustrious Toilet Bowl).  These are of course only estimates, but they are also infallible.  If something doesn't happen as predicted, clearly cheating happened.  I have spoken.
