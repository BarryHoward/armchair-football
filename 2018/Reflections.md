# Reflections

## Introduction

As your champion this year and as your scribe, it falls to me to offer my reflections on this season, so that when we look back upon it, we can fully appreciate it's place in the collective history of GE and therefore the world.  I accept this self-appointed role with humilty only I can muster.  You're welcome.

First off, I would like to congratulate everyone on our best season yet.  They say that a fantasy football league is not judged by winners and losers, but on the amount of rage quits -- of which there were plenty.  Drama is the flavor of life, and this season was a flavor explosion, filled with the kinds of stories and narratives that ESPN only dreams about, as they get people to yell at each other about LeBron's shoes for 3 hours a day.

## Notable Tales

* The bottom three finishers last year were able to rise to 1st, 4th and 7th respectively.  A true victory for the underdog.

* Grant finished the regular season despite "quitting" three or more times.  A testament to resiliency.

* Lynn and Francesca haven't been expelled yet for negligence.  Yea, for we are merciful.

* Barry's many trades enabled multiple teams to succeed.  A new model for teamwork in these polarized times.

* Jonathan was able to finally defeat Jack in the playoffs.  Cold dishes save on heating costs.

* Finally, a villain emerged this season.  A villain so insidious that the league banded together in opposition to the incessant trash talk and the horrifying spectre of a super team.  And when I defeated Jonathan, the league rejoiced in a way only the oppressed can when liberated.  "Hero" they called me, but I reject such labels. I merely accept your thanks... and the cash amount of $400.

## A Way Forward

So much drama, so much pain, so many (failed) attempts to leave the slack channel.  How can a league recover from such intense conflict and soldier on?  How can we mend the bridges that divide us?  My answer:  To give into drama.  To remember this pain and relish in repaying your adversaries ten-fold.  I am reminded of the great warrior Conan, who when asked "What is best in life?" responded

    "To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their wallets."

Be like Conan.

As for me, I will be taking a break from scribing duties after this post.  I bid you all farewell, for I have a ski trip to go on, and the league is paying for it!
