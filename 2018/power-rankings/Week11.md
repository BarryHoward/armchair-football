## Tier 1 -- Championship Contenders

1 - **The Art of the Deal (9-1-0 | 1225.10)** -- Hail to the Chief!  After a few wins that some would call luck, Barry's team has finally arrived with a 5 game winning streak, back-to-back 130+ performances, and the blowout of the year (thanks to both the highest and lowest point totals of the season).   With the first clinched playoff spot, a one game lead for first, a trending upward team, and Dalvin Cook finally returning this week, the Trump Trouncers are the team to beat going into the playoffs despite the recent drama.  This week Jen will be the first to face this fully armed and operational super team.

2 - **Revenge Tour (8-2-0 | 1226.77)** -- Despite his failed attempts to oust our dear commissioner, Andrew is still the favorite to clinch the second BYE spot in the playoffs due to a good spot in the standings and a sizeable point lead on Cheryl.  Coming into this week with a 5 game winning streak -- despite last weeks middling performance -- Andrew will need to up his game if he wants to hold onto his spot though, as 3-7 2SpoonSwaggu is dangerous enough to steal one if Andrew repeats with a sub 90 score.

3 - **Technical Difficulty (8-2-0 | 1140.91)** -- After back-to-back embarassing losses for the previously undefeated Queen of the league, Cheryl bounced back for a must-win performance against Jonathan's tough luck squad.  Once again showing why she was the top of the league, Cheryl is still in the running for the second BYE and is all but assured a playoff spot after making it through the toughest part of her schedule.  Unfortunately, she has to go up against upstart Grant this week in yet another dangerous game.

4 - **Haters Gonna Hate (6-4-0 | 1275.84)** -- Embattled both on and off the field, Jonathan again gets beat by a team who was struggling during a week when he was held to under 130 points for the first time in forever.  At 6-4, Jonathan is clinging tighely to his overall point lead, as his record is borderline at best.  Still one of the most dangerous teams, Jonathan has a remote chance of missing the playoffs if he keeps getting unlucky, but a matchup with last place Russell will hopefully remedy the situation.

## Tier 2 -- Playoff Pushers

5 - **Eagle Eye (6-4-0 | 1177.91)** -- Anthony was able to perform better than his beloved Eagles this week, as he put a beatdown on the hapless Euro Duo.  Despite a mediocre record, a considerable points lead over the pack means that Anthony has a very good chance of nabbing a playoff spot, but with Sony Michel no longer being reliable for points, Eagle Eye may need to eye a replacement if he wants to guarantee his playoff spot and a deep run.

6 - **For Sale (5-5-0 | 1062.86)** -- It's clearly a sellers market, as the For Sale squad has catapulted from bottom tier team to legitimate contender, thanks largely to the Saints offense putting up historic numbers.  Back-to-back 137 point weeks have put him into a tight race with Adam for the final playoff spot, not to mention making him one of the hottest teams in the league.  Outside of Drew Brees and Michael Thomas, however, his team might have a hard time competing, but if those two stay hot, there's no telling what will happen when Hurricane Kapowski matches up against Cheryl's top tier team.

7 - **Gronkey Kong (5-5-0 | 1060.15)** -- Almost as hot as Grant and in a virtual tie in the standings for the last playoff spot, Adam can't take his foot off the gas now that he's no longer in jeopardy of holding onto the toilet trophy.  He needs to squeeze every point out of his squad in his attempt to sneak into the postseason ahead of Grant or possibly Anthony.  Interestingly, Adam has an opportunity this week to knock off Anthony to pull even with a 6-5 record.  However, a tough matchup in a must-win game might be less than ideal if Gronky Kong can't perform now that he has that monkey off his back.

8 - **Alan Dutch Schaefer (4-6-0 |1077.89)** -- Jack is technically still alive in the playoff hunt thanks to a thumping of the often negligent HR squad.  His points scored should give him a slight edge over Grant and Adam, but he'll need to pick up a game on both if he wants to return to the postseason for the second season in a row.  Hanging on by a thread, Jack will need to win out for a shot, including an easy matchup this week and next week's matchup against Cheryl.

9 - **ShePersisted (5-5-0 | 993.95)** -- Jen continues to falter, as she again falls in a matchup she needed to have in order to hold her playoff spot.  Now on the outside looking in, #ShePersisted is borrowing a popular hashtag in the hopes that it will lead to additional support for her struggle, but going up against the unholy abomination that Barry has constructed, she stands alone -- her playoff hopes fading underneath the shadow of the 30 points deficit she'll have to overcome.  Now in the midst of a crowded playoff picture with no tie-breakers, it's nut up or shut up time for the self-proclaimed feminist icon.

## Tier 3 -- Toilet Teeterers

10 - **2SpoonSwaggu (3-7-0 | 1017.43)** -- On the supposed losing end of the trade that shook the fantasy football world, Jeff returned to putting up solid numbers again last week -- due largely to new acquisition Leonard Fournette.  It wasn't enough, however, as Jeff falls out of playoff contention thanks to a strong week from contender Gronkey Kong.  Though most likely safe from the toilet bowl, this is undoubtedly a lost season for Jeff as the sleeper team prepares for its offseason slumber.

11 - **Teamy McTeamface (3-7-0 | 1003.67)** -- Another victim of getting swallowed by a rising playoff contender, Joe fell victim to Grant's surging team despite putting up his best point total of the year.  Also most likely safe from the toilet bowl, Joe is left to dwell on what could have been, as last year's late season surprise waited too long to start making noise and is now doomed to fade quietly into the night.

12 - **neuni≈°tiv (3-7-0 | 945.97)** -- On the verge of both a toilet bowl birth and a banning from the league, any chances of playoff magic for team HR can now be as safely ignored as their roster.  Despite having the top scoring player in the league, Lynn and Fracesca's lack of commitment and experience has cost them any chance at glory.  Now they will need to pray that they avoid last place as well as the commissioner's wrath.

13 - **TeachMeHow2EuroTrip (3-7-0 | 884.49)** --  Despite the most effort out of the bottom three, Hannah and Mike are approaching Cleveland levels of futility.  Fortunate to have drawn Jeff at his lowest moment, the Cleveland Stinkers are still in position to avoid the toilet bowl -- barely -- despite putting up 62 points last week.  But if that is to remain the case, this week may be a must-win, as it may be the only winnable game they have left this season.

14 - **Harooga Hand Ball (2-8-0 | 897.57)** -- The recipient of the beatdown of the year, Russell put up the lowest point total of the season, and the sad part is that nobody was really surprised.  Poor management has lead to a roster in dissaray and a record that should make a grown man blush.  He needs at least one more win and for EuroTrip to lose their last three to avoid the toilet bowl, but considering his schedule, he may just want to start making room on his desk for the tiny toilet he has so rightly earned.
