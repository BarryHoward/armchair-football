## Week 4

1 ) Dream Drowners  4-0-0 (502.81) -- The highest scoring undefeated team retains the top spot after scoring the blowout of the week against the floundering 0-4 croatian crew.  After a somewhat uninspired first week, Dream Drowners has scored 130+ points in three consecutive weeks and remains top dog for now.  A matchup against Hit em High should prove a bit more competitive.

2 ) Eagle Eye 3-1-0 (526.51) -- The overall point leader rolls again to another 130+ point performance.  After a close loss to open the season, Eagle has been quietly dominating opponents to little fanfare.  They match up against one of the two remaining undefeateds this week in the hopes of moving up to their rightful place in the rankings.

3 ) Revenge Tour 3-1-0 (504.79) -- Mr. Other League is suddenly in contention for top spot in THIS league.  After losing his first game to top dog Dream Drowners, Revenge Tour honors its name by smashing Jonathan with an impressive 157.95 performance to sneak into the second overall point spot.  With a soft schedule coming up, and LeVeon maybe returning?, the revenge tour doesn't look to be stopping anytime soon.

4 ) Technical Difficulty 4-0-0 (449.40) -- The early frontrunner for Miss Lucky, Technical Difficulty again scratches out a slim victory of 0.39 points!  A middle of the pack point total paired with an undefeated record means any slip up will result in a quick fall, which could come soon as Cheryl takes on point leader Eagle Eye this week.

5 ) Hit Em High 2-2-0 (483.29) -- A team that is undoubtedly better than its record, Jonathan's crew is near the top in points scored, but has had to face stiff competition.  The road doesn't get any easier however, as he's now without a TE and is going against undefeated Dream Drowners with his precious Chicago D on BYE.

6 ) Gold Stars 3-1-0 (403.37) -- Somewhat fortunate to be 3-1, Jen's Gold Stars have done just enough to win in some tight matchups.  With Russell Wilson struggling and Gronk sidelined, Jen again fortunately draws a weaker team this week, hoping to keep her momentum going.

7 ) Gronkey Kong 2-2-0 (416.04) -- Now on a 2 game winning streak due mostly to poor performances by its opponents, Adam's squad looks to continue its stumble out of the toilet bowl against Jack's somewhat inconsistent team.  Having McCaffrey coming off of his BYE week should lead to a more impressive point total this week.

8 ) Teamy McTeamface 2-2-0 (406.39) -- Joe's team again comes out of the gate slow with an uninspired points total and a middling record, but Joe fans from last year know he's a second half team.  He looks to start his rebound early this year with a prime matchup against the new Hannah/Mike led team Douglas/Eurotrip

9 ) IDONTBELONGHERE 2-2-0 (408.30) -- Mr. I Don't Care was on a mission to prove it last week with a disasterous 61.58 points scored, causing a major fall in the standings due to record and points scored.  Now that Fitzmagic has poofed and Drew Brees has decided to fallback on his running game, he'll need some better luck against a suddenly dangerous Revenge Tour.

10 ) Alan Dutch Schafer 1-3-0 (404.48) -- A team who's score continues to bounce around like a pinball, Jack's squad looks to shake off a close loss this week with an even matchup against Gronkey Kong.  If Jack's team can return to form, there's still time to make a run into the playoffs similar to last year.  If they fall back into abysmal play, last year's number 2 could end up with everyone's favorite number 2 trophy.

11 ) Harooga Hand Ball 1-3-0 (425.14) -- Newcomer Russell struggled mightily out of the gate, but now that the Falcons offense looks to have returned to form, his squad has put up solid points in back-to-back weeks.  But like the falcons, his defense has led him to an unimpressive record of 1-3.  He looks to continue his luck against Mr. Bad Luck, jeff.

12 ) 2SpoonSwaggu 0-4-0 (414.98) -- Mr. Bad Luck suffers ANOTHER heartbreaking defeat against Miss Lucky by 0.39 points.  Statistically, Jeff is destined to win one of these games, but if his team continues to practice on that Indian Burial Ground, who knows when this drought will end?  Jeff has a favorable matchup agaisnt Russell, but that could turn to tragedy if Russell's team goes off again.

13 ) TeachMeHow2EuroTrip 1-3-0 (381.38) -- Now under new management, Hannah and Mike look to dig themselves out of their early season hole, and now they are off to a good start by squeaking out a victory against Jack.  They'll look to continue the momentum and their quest to avoid the toilet bowl this week against Joe's struggling squad.

14 ) neuništiv 0-4-0 (343.59) -- Loša momčad s lošom srećom, Francesca i Lynn traže sjajne nade nad Jenovom posrtalom policijom. Ovdje nema puno šećera. Čak i promjena na quarterbacku i Cherylova "savjetovanja" možda neće biti dovoljna da bi WC školjka s Lynnovog stola.
