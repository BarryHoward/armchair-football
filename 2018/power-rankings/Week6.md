## Week 6

1) Technical Difficulty (Cheryl) - Technical Difficulty is 6-0 and put up a monster score this week. After league chatter of this team falling off, she leaves no doubt this week as the clear cut first place team. We'll see what the second half of the season brings but barring a monumental collapse Cheryl will be on her way to the playoffs again. 

2) Hit Em High (Jonathan) - The league has a new points leader. After losing to Gronkey Kong, Hit Em High has been red hot and hasn't posted less than 135pts the past 3 weeks.  Jonathan will look to keep it going against Grant in the battle of blue cloud vs orange cloud in week 7. 

3) Eagle Eye (Anthony) - Eagle Eye starts both the 2nd and 3rd best running backs in fantasy football. To top that off Anythony has Sony Michel, who is starting to come on strong for the Pats. With such a potent rushing attack, this team is going to light up the score board every week. 

4) Dream Drowners (Barry) - The former first place team moves down a couple spots after putting up a low score this week. Barry is still 5-1 and a dangerous team with depth. 

5) Revenge Tour (Andrew) - Revenge Tour cooled off a bit this week but still gets the W. Andrew continues to make solid plug and play pickups each week and puts himself in the best position to win. 

6) Gronkey Kong (Adam) - Adam is determined to not win the toilet bowl this year and it shows. Sitting firmly in the playoff hunt at the midway point, Adam will look for the upset in a tough matchup against Technical Difficulty in week 7. 

7) IDontBelongHere (Grant) - Grant's team had a case of the bye week blues last week with his two top players not playing. Look for him to put up more points this week in his matchup against Hit Em High. 

8) 2SpoonSwaggu (Jeff) - 2SpoonSwaggu finally has some key pieces healthy/off suspension. This "sleeper" squad might be ready to make a run with solid WRs and a decent rushing attack. A matchup with FlagHR this week has Jeff staring at 3 wins in row. 

9)  Alan Dutch Schaefer (Jack) - Jack has lost some very close games this season. He could very well be 4-2 but instead is at 2-4 and sits in 10th place. Poor roster management burned him this past week leaving serious points on the bench. 

10) Gold Stars (Jen) - The Gold Stars have plummeted in the standings, losing to the 2SpoonSwaggu last week in a low scoring affair. Jen will have to find a way to put up points with a week 7 matchup against high scoring Eagle Eye looming. 

11) Harooga Handball (Russell) - HaroogaHandball has lost 3 in a row and is struggling. To top it off Russell's team hasn't scored more than 90pts the past two weeks. He'll need to find a way to re-capture that week 3 magic.

12) TeamyMcTeamFace (Joe) - TeamyMcTeamFace looked good on paper at the start of the season but hasn't seemed to be able to put it together. Injuries are killing this team's potential. 

13) FlagHR (Lynn/Francesca) - This team has the #1 player statistically in all of fantasy football...hopefully that will keep them away from the toilet bowl in the second half of the season.

14) TeachMeHowToEuro (Hannah/Mike) - I'm not sure if having Mike as a co-manager is helping here. Johnny Manziel is not walking through that door (even if he was would you really want him???).  Maybe it's time to start planning the toilet bowl desk rotation between the two managers.
