## Tier 1

1. Technical Difficulty (7-0-0 / 859.75) - A week after silencing the haters, Cheryl again puts up consistently good numbers against another under-performing squad.  Now that her points scored has placed her firmly in the top tier, her undefeated record is unquestioned, making her the undoubted number 1 team midway through the year.

2. Haters Gonna Hate (5-2-0 / 896.01) - Jonathan has now dominated for four straight weeks and is clearly the team nobody wants to face right now.  The only downside -- if it can be called that -- to this squad is its record, as his trio of RBs is undoubtedly the best in the league after Anthony's recent issues.  He matches up against Jack's reeling squad this week, and is the clear favorite.

3. Dream Drowners (6-1-0 / 816.20) - After disappointing points scored over the last few weeks, Barry's squad is falling behind in the points scored race.  His record and some new acquisitions though keep him in the 3rd spot.  With his trades for Zeke and Amari, Dream Drowners should be in prime position to make a massive playoff push.  Both are on BYE this week though, so Barry will need to win a shorthanded vitory if he wants to remain in overall second in the standings.

4. Revenge Tour (5-2-0 / 859.22) - Another solid performance from Andrew's team has pushed him to a 5-2 record going into a much anticipated matchup against league-leader Cheryl.  Starting Derek Carr isn't ideal however, but if he can pull off the minor upset, there's a good chance he jumps into the top three.  Still waiting on LeVeon...

5. Eagle Eye (4-3-0 / 874.75) - The former owner of 2 of the top 3 RBs in the league is reeling after an injury to Melvin Gordon and a tough loss to a suddenly resurgent Gold Stars.  Despite his impressive points scored total, he could end up falling out of playoff position if he can't pull out a win in a somewhat even matchup agianst Jeff.

    ## Tier 2

6. Spooky Gold Stars (4-3-0 / 704.52) - Jen is probably not as good as her team played last week, but some improvements at RB and Russell Wilson coming off BYE might mean a new and improved team at least.  If she can secure a win against underdogs Hannah and Mike her plans for the playoffs might not be so premature.

7. Gronkey Kong (3-4-0 / 727.49) - Adam's team again underperformed against Cheryl's practice squad and wasn't able to unseat the champ as many had hoped.  While not in immediate danger of repeating as toilet bowl champ, his team will need to improve significantly if he wants to make it to the playoffs in a crowded second tier.

8. IDONTBELONGHERE (3-4-0 / 704.37) - Grant was the latest of Jonathan's hapless victims last week as he fell by nearly 40 points.  His middling team has kept itself in the playoff hunt, but like most people, he will need some RB help if he wants to take his team to the postseason.

9. 2SpoonSwaggu (2-5-0 / 725.86) - Jeff's team had started to turn its season around, but ran into some more bad luck as the HR squad put up its best point total of the year.  It's getting late in the season for everyone's favorite underdog to make his run, but his points scored would indicate that he still has a playoff shot.

10. Teamy McTeamface (3-4-0 / 673.79) - A rough week for Joe as his team failed to meet expectations and his trade for a QB might have passed him by.  The longer the season goes, the more and more likely that Joe isn't going to make his run, but at 3-4, if his team does turn around, it's not too late to push to the playoffs.  This week he'll look to make Dream Drowners regret trading for so many players on BYE.

11. Alan Dutch Schaefer (2-5-0 / 699.88) - Is it better to be good or lucky?  All I know is that if you started Blake Bortles last week, you were neither, as everyone's favorite bi-polar squad again put up depressing results this week -- mostly due to Bortles putting up under 2 pts from the QB position.  Now that he has traded away arguably his best player to rectify the situation, it's do or die this week as he goes up against the behemoth that is Jonathan's squad.

    ## Tier 3

12. neuni≈°tiv(2-5-0 / 684.24) - Team HR took a big step this week to move out of last place with it's best showing of the year.  At this level, wins are precious and so are points, and Lynn and Francesca just secured both for the week.  While not totally wowing anybody, they are playing better for now and should no longer be considered a free win.

13. TeachMeHow2EuroTrip (2-5-0 / 641.30) - For all of Hannah and Mike's talk, the results hadn't come until this week where they were able to sneak by last place Russell in a battle of bottom teams.  While this was a huge step to keep out of last place, their competition will obviously stiffen going forward, and Russell and Team HR will be looking to capitalize.

14. Harooga Hand Ball (1-6-0 / 651.35) - A team that had started to show promise has fallen by the wayside due to an absentee manager and general lack of experience.  Top waiver priority is great thing to have, but it comes at a price, as Russell is now the odds on favorite for the toilet bowl.  Hopefull his pickup this week can make the difference.
