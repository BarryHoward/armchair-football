# Power Rankings

Author: Barry (The Art of the Deal)

This will be the last set of power rankings before the playoffs, since next week will be playoff odds breakdown.

## Top Tier Titans

### 1 - The Art of the Deal

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 8-3-0 | 1308.85 | 1115.7 | 118.99 | 101.43 | 3-0-0 | 135.22 | 94.93 |



Death, taxes, Barry at the top of the standings.  Some things in this world are all but certain.  After 4 straight weeks of dominance, Barry has finally capitalized on the stumbles of Danielle and Joe and is now in line for a second straight year of being the top seed.  Furthermore, an uncharacteristically poor showing by Joe has again put him in striking distance of the points championship.  Current standings + recent results make Barry the favorite for the repeat, a horrible prospect or the rest of the league who seem unable to even hold down a cripple.

### 2 - noLuck

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/RedDownArrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 7-4-0 | 1322.13 | 1180.57 | 120.19 | 107.32 | 2-1-0 | 111.73 | 102.81 |



The invincible Joe finally faltered when he went up against the volcano that was Alicia's streaking squad.  A sub-90 performance has also put his points championship in doubt, as he has also slipped out of a first round Bye spot.  Look for him to rebound though, as he faces last place Andrew with half his team on Bye, but unless he can keep up with Barry's surge, he's in significant danger of losing that guaranteed points money.

## Dandy Dancers

### 3 - A1 Since Day 1

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 4 | 7-4-0 | 1154.52 | 1074.88 | 104.96 | 97.72 | 3-0-0 | 107.4 | 84.74 |



The newest superstar of the league, Alex has armpit sniffed her way from zero to hero, winning 5 in a row and 7 of her last 8, to go from worst to one game out of first.  A testament to resilience and teams ignoring Michael Thomas still for some reason, Alex has pushed her way past the bubble into prime playoff position.  A few things go her way, and she might even have a playoff Bye, but a loss this week to bubble boy Jonathan could send her right back down the rankings.

### 4 - Mrs. OBJ

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/RedDownArrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 8-3-0 | 1184.87 | 1041.03 | 107.72 | 94.64 | 2-1-0 | 92.72 | 93.35 |



You could be forgiven for still thinking of Danielle as a contender given her place in the rankings, but her recent string of low-90 performances say otherwise.  Having hung onto her crown with moxie more than anything, Danielle took a tumble with her first loss in four weeks.  Going into the playoffs, her position is still good, but her teams performance implies a one and done, especially if she can't keep a grip on the BYE spot.

### 5 - Kiss the Baby

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 5 | 7-4-0 | 1109.05 | 1037.86 | 100.82 | 94.35 | 3-0-0 | 112.99 | 90.27 |



Possibly the streakiest player in the league, Alicia is in the midst of a 3 game winning streak, and given the logjam near the middle of the pack, she's separated herself with her 7-4 record.  Despite having escaped the Jen Curse, she is, however, at a huge point disadvantage to 2/3 of the 6-5 teams, meaning a slip up is going to most likely cost her a playoff spot.  Of the current playoff teams, she may have the toughest road, as she has to go through Barry and then Jen in what will most likely be a final winner take all game for a playoff spot.

## Bubble Buddies

### 6 - Haters Gonna Hate

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 2 | 6-5-0 | 1180.09 | 1126.92 | 107.28 | 102.45 | 2-1-0 | 119.02 | 108.35 |



No team has been more up and down than Jonathan this year, and that trend continues, as he drops a must have win against basement dweller Ben.  Struggling to escape mediocrity, his 6-5 record is holding him back from the upper echelon, as he is only 4 points behind Danielle for 3rd in points.  Unfortunately, he'll need to end Alex's 5 game win streak if that is to even matter, as his position on the bubble could burst his chance as redemption before he even gets started.

### 7 - Silver Snakes

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/RedDownArrow.svg' width='15px'> 2 | 6-5-0 | 1150.29 | 1137.66 | 104.57 | 103.42 | 1-2-0 | 97.29 | 106.83 |



Despite trading away a playoff team for scraps, Jen is still in the mix of things, now currently right outside playoff position.  Her point total isn't too impressive, so she'll most likely have to win out to secure her spot.  Will being backed into a corner finally unleash the fabled Zen Jen... Or will she be the only one of the 4 women in the league to not make the playoffs?  Please update me on her flip outs.  I'm in need of good entertainment these days.

### 8 - red rocket

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/RedDownArrow.svg' width='15px'> 4 | 6-5-0 | 1106.1 | 1187.07 | 100.55 | 107.92 | 1-2-0 | 85.05 | 100.67 |



Dan's season may have just been saved last night, and Jeff's Chiefs AGAIN fell to injury.  Of all the bubble teams, Dan may have the easiest schedule, but the red rocket will need to blast off again if he wants into this the dance, as his last three weeks have not been play off worthy.  Now that he has a second chance, will team rocket surrender now or prepare to fight?  Only time will tell.

## Couch Crashers

### 9 - Eagle Eye

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/RedDownArrow.svg' width='15px'> 3 | 4-7-0 | 1164.22 | 1153.18 | 105.84 | 104.83 | 0-3-0 | 87.44 | 114.65 |



Oh, how the 'mighty' have played to their actual expectations.  After getting carried by one of the most prolific fantasy defenses in history, Anthony has woken up from his blissful slumber to find himself in the midst of a 4 game losing streak and firmly out of the playoff picture.  At 4-7 it is even possible that he swoops in for a late season toilet bowl run, though his points total will probably protect him.  In any case, he is guaranteed a losing record, and this makes me happier than it should.

### 10 - Azan-axe

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 5-6-0 | 1011.75 | 1076.63 | 91.98 | 97.88 | 1-2-0 | 90.29 | 96.44 |



Tim is probably the highest ranked team with no real playoff prospects.  Right outside the bubble, and having not put up more than 100 pts since week 4, Tim's caught in limbo -- too bad for the playoffs, too good for the toilet bowl.  Overall, he's done a fine job for a first timer, with a lot of potential for improvement.  His matchups against Alicia and Andrew will undoubtedly have an impact on the final standings, so Tim is in perfect position to play spoilier.

### 11 - The Paradise Process

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/RedDownArrow.svg' width='15px'> 2 | 4-7-0 | 1084.24 | 1145.31 | 98.57 | 104.12 | 0-3-0 | 91.91 | 120.19 |



After flirting with a .500 record for most of the season, Jack has taken after his beloved Dolphins, lost three in a row, and begun to tank -- possibly on route to something dirty.  With the three amigos all scraping together a win recently, Jack has entered into the toilet bowl conversation, a disappointing fate for the perennial contender.  His final game against Ben could very likely decide if this down turn is going to end in a full-on crater.

## Shit Tier Shoguns

### 12 - Ben's Notable Team

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -- | 3-8-0 | 1083.35 | 1209.8 | 98.49 | 109.98 | 1-2-0 | 98.78 | 98.48 |



Well, his disastrous 8 game losing streak has been snapped, but Ben can't let the foot of the gas yet.  After handing Jonathan a crushing blow to his playoff hopes, Ben now has to matchup with 2 other toilet bowl contenders to finish off the season.  For those who enjoy the shit circus, it doesn't get any better than this, as Ben tries to hold off Jeff and Jack to escape unscathed, as his once promising season turns into a not-so-sexy mud wrestling match.  Personally, I'm pretty excited.

### 13 - 2SpoonSwaggu

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -- | 3-8-0 | 1007.15 | 1177.68 | 91.56 | 107.06 | 1-2-0 | 93.37 | 108.58 |



Is God merciful or is He cruel and unforgiving?  I'm sure Jeff has some thoughts on that philosophical question, as God decided to push him back down into the toilet bowl race with yet another Tyreek injury.  Unable to amass 85 points to beat a struggling Dan, Jeff had to watch his team fall as his main competition both experienced uncharacteristic wins.  With a razor-thin points lead on Andrew, Jeff has to go up against a resurgent Ben and the unstoppable Alex if he wants to avoid his ironic fate.  Good news is that after all the 'anything but the toilet bowl' talk, if Jeff gets it, they will tell his story for years to come.

### 14 - Eat Dawg Eat

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Record (Last 3) | Avg Points (Last 3) | Avg Points Against (Last 3)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -- | 3-8-0 | 996.83 | 1199.15 | 90.62 | 109.01 | 1-2-0 | 92.28 | 95.23 |



Andrew's team is not good.  We all know this, but since Saquon came back, it's not the worst team either.  Andrew has two week to pinch by someone in the tightest toilet bowl race yet.  Unfortunately, he's going up against the top 2 points scorers in the league.  His best bet may be to hope someone else loses twice, while he passes them in points -- a somewhat conceivable possibility given recent results, but right now, Andrew is still the predicted pooper.
