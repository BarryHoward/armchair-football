## Trades

<details>

### Trade 1

#### Exchange

| Ben's Notable Team | Silver Snakes |
|:---:|:---:|
| Kirk Cousins | Tyler Boyd |


#### Opinion

Jen traded a possible WR1 for a backup QB.  In retrospect that seems even worse, since Cousins is either not going to throw the ball or he's going to throw it badly.  This is all made worse by Lamar Jackson's breakout first 2 weeks.  A nice example of why you should avoid trading before the season starts.

#### Results

Jen regrets trading before she found out that Lamar Jackson is apparently good now.

### Trade 2

#### Exchange

| The Art of the Deal | Ben's Notable Team |
|:---:|:---:|
| John Brown | Antonio Brown |


#### Opinion

A WR1 for a WR2 doesn't look great on paper, but AB has just gotten released from the Raiders, done a bunch of crazy nonsense on instagram, and been accused of rape.  If the accusation holds any water (or if the NFL just doesn't want to look bad), AB could be done playing for a while.  Otherwise, AB in the Patriots offense is a huge upgrade for his upside.  If AB plays, Barry gets a WR1 for cheap.  If he doesn't Ben gets a solid WR2 for next to nothing.

#### Results

Jonathan was not happy.

### Trade 3

#### Exchange

| The Art of the Deal | 2SpoonSwaggu |
|:---:|:---:|
| Robert Woods | Melvin Gordon III |
| Terry McLaurin |  |

#### Opinion

Another high risk move by Barry that could pay off in the long term.  After the injuries to Alshon Jeffery and Tyreek Hill, Jeff was in desperate need of WR help, and he got 2 seemingly solid WR2.  Woods, the more established, and McLaurin the possible breakout star.  If Gordon comes back later in the year, it's probably a win-win for both teams as Jeff was teetering on the brink and Barry wanted to improve his team for late in the season.  If Gordon doesn't play, Jeff filled his biggest need for nothing.

#### Results

Jonathan was REALLY not happy.

## Power Rankings

This season started off with all sorts or surprises both in the NFL and in our league.  With this in mind, I think my preseason rankings were pretty close with a few notable exceptions.  Enjoy the new format.

### Championship Contenders

1 - **Mrs. OBJ**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 10 | 2-0-0 | 279.71 | 187.23 | 139.855 | 93.615 |

```But champions dig themselves out of TE-shaped holes all the time, so she should have a chance to improve on this minor issue.```

Novice or Secret Genius?  In a year where everyone seemingly has a major draft bust and injuries grip the league in fear, Danielle seemingly made all the right moves on draft day and has leaped to the front of the back.  More than anything, her success can be traced to the breakout of the Ravens offense and the emergence of Mark Andrews as one the league's top TE -- something we clearly all saw coming.  AJ Green might be out longer than anticipated and Ekeler's stellar start should only last as long as Melvin Gordon is holding out, but otherwise there is nothing to suggest that a little maintenance will keep this team in championship form for the rest of the season.

2 - **The Art of the Deal**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -- | 2-0-0 | 240.6 | 199.46 | 120.3 | 99.73 |

```So if y'all are looking to make some trades that will piss off the rest of the league, I'm always listening.```

Welp, the defending champion is back to his old tricks, acquiring top-tier talent in risky trades that might pay huge dividends.  After acquiring a hold-out RB1 and a WR1 with a few accusations over his head and more than a few mental issues, Barry is well on his way to dominating the league for a second year in a row if his perilous trades bear fruit.  But even if they don't, he still has a solid team with better bench depth than he had two weeks ago thanks to his fortunate avoiding of the injuries plaguing the rest of the league amd some savvy waiver wire pickups.  This week will should be a great matchup, as the trophy-owner takes on upstart Danielle in what might be a possible playoff preview.

3 - **Haters Gonna Hate**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 2-0-0 | 211.81 | 181.93 | 105.905 | 90.965 |

```Jonathan knows by now that 'good' isn't good enough come playoff time, so I hardly expect him to be complacent.```

If you were to talk to Jonathan over the last week, you might not realize that he is sitting at 2-0 after dismantling rival Jack.  Cranky that trades are happening without him, Jonathan has been mostly quiet moves-wise, leaning on a solid roster to dispatch his first two opponents.  With Devonta Freeman starting to look like a bust and Gallup going down for a few weeks, Mr. Reed may need to make a little more noise if he wants to hang with the pack long-term, but for now he's still a solid contender off to a good start for the year.  He goes into an even matchup with Anthony this week.

4 - **red rocket**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 2-0-0 | 214.05 | 180.08 | 107.025 | 90.04 |

```While heavily dependent on a resurgent year from Tom Brady...```

One of only a handful of people that likes Antonio Brown at the moment, Dan's bet on Mr. Brady looks like it's going to payout big, as the 50 year old avocado husk now has one of the best receiving corps in the league to throw to.  This in addition to Dalvin Cook ironically being healthy for once has led to red rocket's hot start.  While not exactly obliterating his opponents, Dan has managed to put up decent numbers both weeks against weaker opponents to remain undefeated so far.  After a struggling Tim, his schedule tightens up significantly, so he will need to up his game a bit if he wants to keep out of the loss column.

5 - **Silver Snakes**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 5 | 2-0-0 | 221.54 | 176.14 | 110.77 | 88.07 |

```She came away with solid RB and WR groups but dreadful QB and TE groups -- if you can even call them that, since she only got one QB.```

Case in point on why Preseason rankings are not to be trusted, almost everything I said about Jen's team has been proven incorrect in less than two weeks --  the exception being my prediction that she would make an early panic trade.  The team that she didn't trade away, however, has been a revelation.  Her 'dreadful' TE group has been solid, with Waller in particular having some good upside.  In her QB (not Kirk Cousins), she has found her own mini-Mahomes that has been carrying an otherwise middling squad.  For Jen, a lot will come down to whether the Ravens offense can stay hot and if Conner, Evans, and Diggs decide they want to start scoring points again.  This week she has a tough matchup with the down-but-dangerous noLuck squad.

6 - **The Paradise Process**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 1-1-0 | 229.63 | 211.09 | 114.815 | 105.545 |

```It seems that only Jack and Yahoo think that Jordan Howard is going to be relevant in the Eagles offense this year.```

Stop me if you've heard this before:  Jack dominates one week, Jack gets crushed the next, Jack is in the middle of the pack.  Once again, Jack-in-the-box starts the season bouncing up and down -- going from nightmare fuel to harmless joke.  After breakout performances by Sammy Watkins and Deshaun Watson, both under-performed, and Jack suffered a pretty rough defeat.  His inconsistency might continue unfortunately, since Jordan Howard turned out to be the bust we all feared, and he is without a true RB2.  A few great players and a few not-so-great players means Jack will continue to be inconsistent until he can fill some gaps in his lineup.  I still think this has the foundation of playoff team, but there's a lot of work to be done.

### Middle Men

7 - **Ben's Notable Team**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Green-Up-Arrow.svg' width='15px'> 1 | 2-0-0 | 207.45 | 184.96 | 103.725 | 92.48 |

```Also, it will help him significantly if Baker Mayfield is as good as Mike thinks he is.```

Narrator:  He isn't.  After fleecing Jen for Tyler Boyd, Ben was the latest person to grow tired of AB's shenanigans, as he shipped him off to Barry for a much more stable receiver.  Ben's real issue, however, might be that Cleveland is starting to play like the Browns, which is having an effect on cocksure Baker Mayfield.  Unfortunately, a little ice cream is his only option unless Andy Dalton regains that Ginger magic.  This combined with him STILL starting Lesean McCoy at RB2 means that Ben may need to make some course corrections in the coming weeks, though his competition is pretty week for the next two weeks.

8 - **noLuck**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |

```He is pinning all his hopes on the increasingly injury-prone Cam Newton with no legitimate backup in place```

Sometimes teams struggle, and the cause eludes me for quite a while.  This is not one of those times.  Cam Newton is the cause of Joe's pain, and you hate to see it.  In my humble opinion, Cam Newton is a loud-mouthed bum whom I have hated for most of a decade, and I can't help but revel in his precipitous decline.  Here's a guy who's only saving graces are his arm strength and his legs, and right now he doesn't have either.  Now he has to rely on his concussion-addled mind to win games, and that clearly ain't happening.  As for Joe, he has an elite team being dragged down by poor QB play and the highest points against in the league (by a considerable margin).  He's put up almost 200 points, with his QB only providing 17 of them.  I expect Joe to rebound soon with or without Cam at QB.  He is still a very dangerous team.

9 - **Eagle Eye**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |

```Nelson Agholor and Desean Jackson are probably not starters on a championship team```

Only one can live while the other survives.  Desean Jackson, in spite of my prediction, had a monster first game for Anthony.  Desean then got broken in half by the Falcons secondary, and Agholor suddenly becomes a top WR.  It seems I was half right in that one -- but not both  -- of those receivers can start for a championship team.  Despite all the Eagle WR jockeying, Anthony has managed to go 1-1.  But diving into these results... when a defense puts up 1/3 of a team's points, and the win comes at the expense of an opponent that only scored 55, one begins to question sustainability.  Anthony may have moved up in the rankings, but I can't help but think he shouldn't unpack his things, as he might be heading back down real soon.

```A regression by the Chief's offense or a lengthy Melvin Gordon holdout may be the only things that can possibly keep Jeff out of the playoffs this year```

Oh, Jeff, you poetic, noble land-mermaid, I'm sorry this has happened to you again.  I feel partially responsible that in my rush to crown Jeff preseason champion, I did not foresee the tornado of severed limbs that would befall him.  Tyreek Hill, Ben Roethlisberger, Hunter Henry, Alshon Jeffrey, and Tyrell Williams are just some of the players injured on Jeff's watch.  Last year's Mr. Unlucky has outdone himself this time, as despite having a championship team in his infirmary, Jeff will need to pull himself out of an early season hole.  Luckily, he should make some good money now that his life story is being made into a major motion picture.  A heartwarming tale of a down-on-his-luck underdog that audiences are rooting for, Joker is coming to theaters October 4th.

```Kyler needs to play well or he needs to get another QB```

As of now, Kyler has been benched, but Andrew wishes that was his biggest problem.  He may have to absorb two additional busts with OJ Howard putting up 3 points over 2 weeks, and Damien Williams having volume issues.  Two potential busts with no depth to replace them and a QB not panning out yet means Andrew is pretty firmly on the struggle bus for a while.  While there is time for this team to turn itself around, it probably isn't long before he starts telling us how well he's doing in his other league.

```Now he probably has nobody to fall back on if Carr struggles in year 2 under Gruden.```

The people's champion, Tim's year started off with a heartbreaking loss to your lovable champion by a score of 0.31 points -- the new record for closest game (previous was Cheryl winning last year by 0.39).  It's been downhill since.  Another case of a QB situation that is just the tip of the iceberg, Tim has been yet another casualty of the Steelers' ineptitude and of AB stealing targets from other Patriot receivers.  When Le'Veon Bell is your team's only reliable player, you might be in trouble.  The bright side is that Tim has a lot of players under-performing, and one or two of them getting it going could put him back near the middle of the pack.  Unfortunately, the last thing he wants to see right now is Dan's red rocket team.

13 - **Kiss the Baby**

```Hopefully distance away from the rest of the league won't hamstring her trading ability, so that she can capitalize on this early momentum.```

Any momentum Alicia had is officially dead.  Joe Mixon has been a bust so far, Njoku left week 2 without scoring any points, and Phillip Rivers didn't exactly inspire as a QB1.  Overall, her team has the potential to pull out of this early hole, but the results so far have not been pretty.  Now an early contender for the toilet bowl, she's going to have to dookie it out this week to stay ahead of her main competition Alex.  I would say more here, but she doesn't talk to me.

14 - **A1 Since Day 1**

| Change | Record | Total Points | Total Points Against | Avg Points | Avg Points Against | Change |

```This little lady put all her faith in the little man from the team for little people.  Now her fate is linked with that of the New Orleans offense```

A poor bedfellow the Saints offense has turned out to be.  Alex put all her eggs in one basket, and Aaron Donald just smashed that basket on top of his head.  The team Alex drafted was not ideal, but now it's a full-blown catastrophe.  Drew Brees on IR not only drops her QB1, but also severely limits her WR1 and TE1.  Unfortunately, his all happened before Brees put up any points, so Alex managed only a measly 55 points last week, not only costing her a loss, but plummeting her to the bottom of the standings with little hope in sight.  It may be early in the season, but I would be impressed if she can recover from this.
