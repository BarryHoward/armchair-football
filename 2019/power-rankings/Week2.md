## Trades

### Trade 1

#### Exchange

| Ben's Notable Team | Silver Snakes |
|:---:|:---:|
| Kirk Cousins | Tyler Boyd |
|  |  |
|  |  |

#### Opinion

Jen traded a possible WR1 for a backup QB.  In retrospect that seems even worse, since Cousins is either not going to throw the ball or he's going to throw it badly.  This is all made worse by Lamar Jackson's breakout first 2 weeks.  A nice example of why you should avoid trading before the season starts.

#### Results

Jen regrets trading before she found out that Lamar Jackson is apparently good now.

### Trade 2

#### Exchange

| The Art of the Deal | Ben's Notable Team |
|:---:|:---:|
| John Brown | Antonio Brown |
|  |  |
|  |  |

#### Opinion

A WR1 for a WR2 doesn't look great on paper, but AB has just gotten released from the Raiders, done a bunch of crazy nonsense on instagram, and been accused of rape.  If the accusation holds any water (or if the NFL just doesn't want to look bad), AB could be done playing for a while.  Otherwise, AB in the Patriots offense is a huge upgrade for his upside.  If AB plays, Barry gets a WR1 for cheap.  If he doesn't Ben gets a solid WR2 for next to nothing.

#### Results

Jonathan was not happy.

### Trade 3

#### Exchange

|:---:|:---:|
| Robert Woods | Melvin Gordon III |
| Terry McLaurin |  |
|  |  |

#### Opinion

Another high risk move by Barry that could pay off in the long term.  After the injuries to Alshon Jeffery and Tyreek Hill, Jeff was in desperate need of WR help, and he got 2 seemingly solid WR2.  Woods, the more established, and McLaurin the possible breakout star.  If Gordon comes back later in the year, it's probably a win-win for both teams as Jeff was teetering on the brink and Barry wanted to improve his team for late in the season.  If Gordon doesn't play, Jeff filled his biggest need for nothing.

#### Results

Jonathan was REALLY not happy.

Behold your arbitrary draft rankings / bulletin board material.  After much research and number crunching, I can guarantee that these predictions will age like a fine cheese on a hot summer's day.
