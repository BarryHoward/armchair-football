# Week 2 Power Rankings

Behold your arbitrary draft rankings / bulletin board material.  After much research and number crunching, I can guarantee that these predictions will age like a fine cheese on a hot summer's day.

## Championship Contenders

1 - **The Art of the Deal**

Normally not the strongest drafter, I can't help but be excited about this team thanks to Zeke once again finding his way onto my team under questionable circumstances -- and I have his backup in case he misses time. An elite backfield, the top TE, and serviceable players at my other positions, the reigning champ got his quest for a repeat off to a great start this year with a strong overall team. Even with doubts regarding Derek Henry and a somewhat underwhelming bench, this team is an undeniable contender going into week one. It is, however, undeniably inferior to last year's super team, so if y'all are looking to make some trades that will piss off the rest of the league, I'm always listening.

2 - **noLuck**

Despite all the speculation of an early Pat Mahomes pick, Joe went the conservative route and loaded up on RBs, and it will almost certainly pay dividends. Maybe the best RB group in the draft and 2 solid WRs should serve him well as he looks to improve on his 4-9 record from last year. He may end up in another QB situation however, as he is pinning all his hopes on the increasingly injury-prone Cam Newton with no legitimate backup in place. His TE pick also shocked Yahoo a bit, but as falcons fan, I can't help but agree that Austin Hooper is a solid sleeper pick, though I would want a backup if I were him. Joe team should be good -- elite if Cam returns to MVP caliber numbers.

3 - **Haters Gonna Hate**

Jonathan had a plan going into the draft, and he may have stuck to it a bit too much. Reaching for most of his picks, he has upset the Yahoo Gods by scoffing at rankings and ADPs alike. But Ja Reed may be onto something the experts aren't, since despite these reaches, he ended up with a pretty balanced team. He is at least adequate at all the positions that matter, and considering his pedigree, he shouldn't be counted out, as this team is more than good enough to serve as a foundation that can be improved upon. Furthermore, Jonathan knows by now that 'good' isn't good enough come playoff time, so I hardly expect him to be complacent. After all, proving the haters wrong is what Jonathan likes to think he excels at.

4 - **red rocket**

An euphemism for a dog's penis, Chris Drumgoole staring into the abyss, and a misinformation campaign that lasted a month. Many in the league tried to decipher Dan's cryptic clues, hoping to determine the answer to one question: Who would soo-choo choose? Luckily for him, Julio Jones fell right into his lap at the 14th pick in the draft, and he surprised nobody when he took him. Overall, Dan took advantage of a lot of such opportunities and put together a formidable team. While heavily dependent on a resurgent year from Tom Brady, veteran newcomer Dan announced his presence with authority by drafting a top 5 team. A lot of fantasy experience without the added baggage of trust issues plaguing the rest of the veterans, Dan is a force to be reckoned with this year.

5 - **Eat Dawg Eat**

In a change of pace that surprised nobody, Andrew avoided holdout players like the plague this time around, and the end result is a team that has a good chance of playing football. A great WR group and 2 stud running backs assures that he will be competitive early in the season, and while those picks are almost a sure thing, his QB choices are certainly not. Kyler Murray could be the next Pat Mahomes... if the Cardinals suddenly become the Chiefs. He still has some upside, but Andrew is at the mercy of a rookie QB, which is a place that most people don't want to be. The rest of his team can absorb some growing pains, but if this team is going to be an elite squad, Kyler needs to play well or he needs to get another QB.

6 - **The Paradise Process**

Determined to not have another Bortles situation on his hands this year, Jack grabbed the number 2 QB Deshaun Watson early in the draft this year. Along with getting one of the big 3 TEs and a top tier running back, Jack's first three picks had him in good position early. Afterwards, as if often the case, the results were a little more mixed. He ended up with a lot of WR options, but no real standouts, but his real issue might be that it seems that only Jack and Yahoo think that Jordan Howard is going to be relevant in the Eagles offense this year. It's not all lost, however, since if he's wrong, Latavius Murray should be a solid replacement. Overall, his team looks to be in the middle of the pack going into the season, but a few moves and breaks could push him to the top.

## Middle Men

7 - **Ben's Notable Team**

Of the first-time fantasy players, Ben may have impressed the most, as he was able to put together a mostly solid team, aside from a few missteps. Unfortunately, one of those missteps was a doozy, as he repeated my mistake of drafting an aging LeSean McCoy playing for an inept Buffalo offense. I, however, take solace in that I didn't reach for him unlike Ben. The end result is that Ben is missing a lot of depth at RB. The good new though, is that the rest of his team is solid, so if he can secure another stud RB through waivers or trade, he could be a top tier team. Also, it will help him significantly if Baker Mayfield is as good as Mike thinks he is.

8 - **Kiss the Baby**

While the rest of the league taunted each other huddled around a draft table, Alicia's Kiss the Baby avoided making newbie mistakes, took advantage of the lack of distractions, and quietly put together a very good roster alone in Cincinnati. A top tier WR group will hopefully carry her, as she is somewhat weak at RB, and Phillip Rivers, while not the flashiest pick, should keep her from flailing at the QB position. Overall, this has the makings of a very competitive squad. Hopefully distance away from the rest of the league won't hamstring her trading ability, so that she can capitalize on this early momentum.

9 - **Silver Snakes**

Looking to redeem some questionable gut decisions made in her rookie year, stressed-out Strollo clearly did her homework this time for her draft. The results were mixed, however, as she came away with solid RB and WR groups but dreadful QB and TE groups -- if you can even call them that, since she only got one QB. The players at these positions have solid upside though, giving her the makings of a good team, so she won't have to rely on luck as much to stay relevant late this time around. On the other hand, considering her demeanor after the draft, some are wondering if she'll fall back into old habits, dropping and trading away talent as she frets over the shortcomings of an uneven team... The 'I'm not trading this year' pledge seeming less and less likely to be fulfilled... Her constant obsessing driving her closer and closer to madness... But for now, she has a legitimate middle of the pack team, with potential for improvement. You go, girl.

10 - **Mrs. OBJ**

Another newcomer out to forge her own destiny, Danielle picked ahead of the ADP in each of her first 10 picks, though some of those picks might have been pretty savvy. Snatching Gurley, Ryan, and Green before the rest of the league had a chance at them might end up paying huge dividends if Gurley returns to form and Green comes back healthy. While these may be question marks, there's no question that she is lacking at TE. But champions dig themselves out of TE-shaped holes all the time, so she should have a chance to improve on this minor issue. They say you can't win a league with the draft, but you can certainly lose it, and Danielle has managed to avoid doing both, as her team looks to be middle of the pack with a decently high ceiling.

11 - **Azan-axe**

A cautionary tale of not trusting yahoo rankings, Tim's draft was solid, but not as great as his draft ranking would have you think. This is mostly because Yahoo seems to think drafting Kareem Hunt was a good idea. It wasn't. The rest of his team is promising however, with a few exceptions. QB is rarely seen as priority position in fantasy football until you don't have one. Tim doesn't have one, and as such is my front-runner for this season's Bortles Award. Derek Carr as his number 1 QB was problematic, but auto drafting Josh Allen was akin to throwing gas onto the dumpster fire of his own passing game. Now he probably has nobody to fall back on if Carr struggles in year 2 under Gruden. His WR and RB groups are strong enough though, and that's all it takes sometimes for a team to make it's way into the playoffs. Overall, an adequate first draft for the newcomer.

## Toilet Teeterers

12 - **Eagle Eye**

Again, true to his word, Anthony reached for some eagles players. This time it might have been costly, as Nelson Agholor and Desean Jackson are probably not starters on a championship team. Perhaps this could have been avoided if his meeting had lasted long enough for Yahoo to save him from himself. Despite having the receiving attack of a wishbone offense, his team makes up for it in other places. 2 solid running backs, one of the big 3 TEs, and 2 top tier QBs means that Anthony has a lot of trade options if he decides he wants points from the WR position. The problem is that since he only has 2 good RBs, he's going to be starting 3 WRs for the foreseeable future. Look for Anthony to struggle until he gets some help at the receiver position.

13 - **A1 Since Day 1**

New to the league, but certainly not lacking in confidence, Day 1 Alex made a splash with almost every pick in her draft, though not always for the right reason. Heavily reaching for Drew Brees despite the misgivings of most experts, this little lady put all her faith in the little man from the team for little people. Now her fate is linked with that of the New Orleans offense, as they comprise two of her top three picks. These picks came at a price, however, as she is perilously weak at RB, and if Drew Brees struggles, QB as well. She will undoubtedly need to rectify her rushing attack if she is to remain relevant late in the season.

14 - **2SpoonSwaggu**

Some called him a madman. Others called him a genius. Most called him a troll. The point is that no one saw it coming when Jeff snatched Pat Mahomes with his first pick in the draft. The gamble seems to have paid off though, as the Kansas City Chargers may be the best team coming out of the draft. No longer content to lose close games, Jeff stacked his team with week 12 byes (congrats on your free win, Ben), hoping to decimate the competition the other 12 weeks of the season. A regression by the Chief's offense or a lengthy Melvin Gordon holdout may be the only things that can possibly keep Jeff out of the playoffs this year, and both seem pretty unlikely.
