The point is that no one saw it coming when Jeff snatched Pat Mahomes with his first pick in the draft. The gamble seems to have paid off though, as the Kansas City Chargers may be the best team coming out of the draft. No longer content to lose close games, Jeff stacked his team with week 12 byes (congrats on your free win, Ben), hoping to decimate the competition the other 12 weeks of the season. A regression by the Chief's offense or a lengthy Melvin Gordon holdout may be the only things that can possibly keep Jeff out of the playoffs this year, and both seem pretty unlikely."

This is mostly because Yahoo seems to think drafting Kareem Hunt was a good idea. It wasn't. The rest of his team is promising however, with a few exceptions. QB is rarely seen as priority position in fantasy football until you don't have one. Tim doesn't have one, and as such is my front-runner for this season's Bortles Award. Derek Carr as his number 1 QB was problematic, but auto drafting Josh Allen was akin to throwing gas onto the dumpster fire of his own passing game. Now he probably has nobody to fall back on if Carr struggles in year 2 under Gruden. His WR and RB groups are strong enough though, and that's all it takes sometimes for a team to make it's way into the playoffs. Overall, an adequate first draft for the newcomer."

Perhaps this could have been avoided if his meeting had lasted long enough for Yahoo to save him from himself. Despite having the receiving attack of a wishbone offense, his team makes up for it in other places. 2 solid running backs, one of the big 3 TEs, and 2 top tier QBs means that Anthony has a lot of trade options if he decides he wants points from the WR position. The problem is that since he only has 2 good RBs, he's going to be starting 3 WRs for the foreseeable future. Look for Anthony to struggle until he gets some help at the receiver position."

On the other hand, considering her demeanor after the draft, some are wondering if she'll fall back into old habits, dropping and trading away talent as she frets over the shortcomings of an uneven team... The 'I'm not trading this year' pledge seeming less and less likely to be fulfilled... Her constant obsessing driving her closer and closer to madness... But for now, she has a legitimate middle of the pack team, with potential for improvement. You go, girl."

Snatching Gurley, Ryan, and Green before the rest of the league had a chance at them might end up paying huge dividends if Gurley returns to form and Green comes back healthy. While these may be question marks, there's no question that she is lacking at TE. But champions dig themselves out of TE-shaped holes all the time, so she should have a chance to improve on this minor issue. They say you can't win a league with the draft, but you can certainly lose it, and Danielle has managed to avoid doing both, as her team looks to be middle of the pack with a decently high ceiling."

This is mostly because Yahoo seems to think drafting Kareem Hunt was a good idea. It wasn't. The rest of his team is promising however, with a few exceptions. QB is rarely seen as priority position in fantasy football until you don't have one. Tim doesn't have one, and as such is my front-runner for this season's Bortles Award. Derek Carr as his number 1 QB was problematic, but auto drafting Josh Allen was akin to throwing gas onto the dumpster fire of his own passing game. Now he probably has nobody to fall back on if Carr struggles in year 2 under Gruden. His WR and RB groups are strong enough though, and that's all it takes sometimes for a team to make it's way into the playoffs. Overall, an adequate first draft for the newcomer."

This time it might have been costly, as Nelson Agholor and Desean Jackson are probably not starters on a championship team. Perhaps this could have been avoided if his meeting had lasted long enough for Yahoo to save him from himself. Despite having the receiving attack of a wishbone offense, his team makes up for it in other places. 2 solid running backs, one of the big 3 TEs, and 2 top tier QBs means that Anthony has a lot of trade options if he decides he wants points from the WR position. The problem is that since he only has 2 good RBs, he's going to be starting 3 WRs for the foreseeable future. Look for Anthony to struggle until he gets some help at the receiver position."

Heavily reaching for Drew Brees despite the misgivings of most experts, this little lady put all her faith in the little man from the team for little people. Now her fate is linked with that of the New Orleans offense, as they comprise two of her top three picks. These picks came at a price, however, as she is perilously weak at RB, and if Drew Brees struggles, QB as well. She will undoubtedly need to rectify her rushing attack if she is to remain relevant late in the season."

The point is that no one saw it coming when Jeff snatched Pat Mahomes with his first pick in the draft. The gamble seems to have paid off though, as the Kansas City Chargers may be the best team coming out of the draft. No longer content to lose close games, Jeff stacked his team with week 12 byes (congrats on your free win, Ben), hoping to decimate the competition the other 12 weeks of the season. A regression by the Chief's offense or a lengthy Melvin Gordon holdout may be the only things that can possibly keep Jeff out of the playoffs this year, and both seem pretty unlikely."
