# Epilogue

Author: Barry (The Art of the Deal)

So another year of fantasy football comes to a close, and the only people happy with their placement are probably too green to appreciate what they have.  Chaotic doesn't even begin to describe this year in the NFL.  Good teams were bad, bad teams were good, and yet God once again spared the Patriots from what should have been a down year.

On the fantasy side, league veterans are in shambles, as proven players failed to produce and new blood muscled it's way to the top -- in particular the members of the "Girl Power" crew.  Was the almost unbelievable placements of each of this year's inexperienced ladies a testament to female empowerment, an evil conspiracy spearheaded by a devious Bostonian, or further proof that fantasy football is, at the end of the day, still a crapshoot that should be considered illegal office gambling?  We may never know, but we do know that nobody saw these final rankings coming on draft day.  Hopefully they aren't so painful to look at that we don't have half the league drop out next year.  Let's begin...

## Playoff Makers

### 1 - A1 Since Day 1

**1st Place** 

Going from league joke to manager murderer, Alex "Killer Clown" Miller-Browne has emerged from an incredibly unpredictable season to be your 2019 league champion.  While the rest of the league struggled to find consistency, **A1 since Week 4** shrugged off an 0-3 start to go 11-2 the rest of the way, putting together the second best stretch in league history and averaging 142 pts per week in her playoff run -- after dropping her final game of the regular season to 2SpoonSwaggu.  The second time a first-time fantasy player has taken the league, her Saints or bust strategy would probably be imitated in the future if the same strategy hadn't been so much less successful for Jeff.

### 2 - Kiss the Baby

**2nd Place**

A very strong finish for Alicia topped off a mediocre season, landing her 2nd place overall on her first foray in fantasy football.  Her accomplishment becomes all the more impressive when considering that Jen not only spent the year giving her bad advice but cursing her as well.  Despite dropping her final game to the runaway A-train, Alicia knocked out both Barry and Joe -- considered to be the top two teams for most of the year -- in her impressive playoff run.  A testament to getting hot at the right time, Alicia has to feel good about the results of her first year, as many league veterans haven't sniffed this level of success for years.

### 3 - noLuck

**3rd Place**

**Highest Point Scorer**

The highest point scorer and the league favorite for most of the season, anything less than 1st was bound to be a disappointment of Joe.  Unfortunately, his championship dreams came to a sudden end when he fell to upstart Alicia in round 2 of the playoffs after his BYE week.  Clinging to the points total and winning the third place game against fellow BYE week recipient Danielle, however, means that Joe will go home with a considerable amount of cash despite his third place finish.  While maybe not the ending Joe was hoping for, it is a marked improvement from his placement from last year, and being the highest placed league veteran in a chaotic year is something to proud of.

### 4 - Mrs. OBJ

Another story of bitter disappointment, Danielle spent most of the year at the top of the standings despite much of the league questioning her team's merit.  Unfortunately, these questions now seem justified, as she was thrashed by Alex, beaten again by Joe in the third place game, and sent home empty-handed.  In any other year, a fourth place finish by a fantasy newbie would be considered quite the accomplishment, but thanks to Alex and Alicia upstaging her as well as her prime position going into the playoffs, Danielle's "Good for a first timer" consolation may not dull the pain of a playoff collapse.

### 5 - Silver Snakes

The first victim of Alex's rampage, Jen desperate first appearance in the playoffs was short-lived.  While getting her first taste of postseason play was an accomplishment for the second-year manager, she might be left to wonder what could have been had Zen Jen arrived sooner.  Drafting the MVP in the 7th round should have set her up for a playoff run, but trading away two WR1s for next to nothing and never really finding a reliable stable of RBs led to Jen overall fielding a mediocre squad, when it could have been a great one.  She can take solace in her "Girl Power" clique having an unbelievable showing, but given her own decision making throughout the season, one has to wonder if the other three ladies succeeded despite Jen's help rather than because of it.

### 6 - The Art of the Deal

Losing the highest points scored award (again) by 5 points, losing a BYE week by three points, and losing the first round of the playoffs by less than two points -- Barry's very promising push for a championship repeat ended in the fantasy equivalent of the Hindenburg crashing into the Titanic while parked on top of a Chernobyl reactor.  Not much else can be said about the unmitigated disaster that was the last four weeks of Barry's season.  Russell Wilson playing like trash, Zeke being underutilized, and an inability to procure a true WR1 all contributed, but questionable decisions are what really kept Barry from going home with anything other than the now faint memory of last year's championship.  Crippled, alone, and living off leftovers in a dark basement, Barry can only scream into the void, as his fantasy empire crumbles around him.

## Couch Haters

### 7 - Azan-axe

Another fledgling newbie that finished in respectable position, Tim, spent most the year around .500, ended one game above, but still missed the playoffs.  A true student of the game, Tim spent the year gathering wisdom and it somewhat paid off, as he finished above expectations, though still below most of the freshman class.  Unfortunately, despite all his tinkering, his roster never became strong enough to break into the postseason, but it wasn't for lack of trying.  Look for Tim to build on his strong first-year performance next season.  A better draft and more experience, and I can see him making playoff noise.

### 8 - Haters Gonna Hate

Like so many league veterans, last year's runner-up had a disappointing campaign, this time left out of the playoffs for the first time.  Jonathan never really got the super team he imagined together, and with the Cowboys and Dak falling off the face of the Earth, Jonathan soon followed.  So close to victory just a year ago, Jonathan's championship wait has now been extended for another season.  But the future is uncertain for our brave commissioner, as his repeated claims of leaving the league have yet to be confirmed.  Perhaps time will heal the wounds of the once proud league favorite in time for 2020 kickoff.

### 9 - The Paradise Process

Again finishing near .500, but this time not sneaking into the playoffs, Jack joins the ranks of disappointed veterans ruined by this years tumultuous football season.  Spending the year waiting for a resurgence from Kamara and Ertz that never came, Jack could only watch as sure bet draft picks proved to be anything but.  A quick look at his roster shows players bounding from single digits to monster games, and his record reflects that.  Jack will need to get more consistency in his draft next year (auction or snake) if he looks to stay in the league and rebound.

### 10 - red rocket

New to the league, but not new to fantasy, Dan spent most of the year looking like an outside threat that never materialized.  Barely missing the playoffs after losing 4 of his last 5 games, Dan's season -- like pretty much every veteran's -- can't help but be seen as a let down.  With Cook falling off and Thielen never getting a good feelin, Minnesota made sure the red rocket's blast off was put on ice this year.  He did put together an admirable effort, however, and will need to build on that if he wants to succeed in this -- or any other -- league.

### 11 - Eagle Eye

Very few things have brought me joy this year, but watching as Anthony's dumpster fire team plummeted in the rankings when the Patriots defense came back to Earth granted me such vindication as I have never known before.  The only thing worse than watching that trash Eagles squad limp into the playoffs would have been to watch Anthony do the same.  I know I have been harsh on Anthony this year, but I truly stand by my position that his team is just the worst.  A textbook example of how NOT to build a roster, Anthony is lucky to have been spared toilet bowl consideration and will have to improve practically every part of his game if he wants to keep it that way.

### 12 - Ben's Notable Team

The Detroit Ray of Sunshine was able to prevent a cloudy off-season by keeping the toilet bowl off his desk.  While 4 wins isn't terrible for a newcomer to the league, it was almost enough to make him the butt of it, since he only squeaked out of last place on a tie-breaker.  The recipient of more Jen trades than anyone else in the league, Ben surely had quite an advantage, but couldn't capitalize despite his relentless optimism.  That may be part of his problem, though, as the Lions suck, and he should probably not load up his team with as many next time.

### 13 - 2SpoonSwaggu

The Tonya Harding of fantasy himself, Jeff probably set the record this year for "accidental" sports injuries.  To those who believe in fate, Jeff's checkered past, morally grey outlook, and dismissal of league outrage may have contributed to his disaster of a season, but I can't comment on that.  In what may have been the shortest-lived favorite in league history, Jeff tumbled down the rankings until he set up camp right near the bottom.  Making questionable move after questionable move in order to pull himself out of the toilet, Jeff barely "succeeded" by eeking out a 13th place finish 28 points ahead of Andrew.  Having accomplished all he wanted this year, however, Jeff may be the only veteran in the league going into the off-season content.

### 14 - Eat Dawg Eat!!

Sitting alone in my house, I often feel a lot of regret for the decisions that have left me so depressingly incapacitated.  More so than any, however, is my regret in missing Jonathan place that toilet bowl trophy on Andrew's desk.  After many accusations of cheating, drive-by trollings, and several attempted coups, I doubt many in the league are shedding tears for our new Ordure Overlord.  Prince of Poop.  Duke of Dookie.  Titan of Toilets.  Andrew now has many titles to choose from, as he spends the long off-season wondering where it all went wrong.  In the meantime, Eat Dawg Eat -- and his beloved bulldogs -- will just have to spend the winter eating shit.
