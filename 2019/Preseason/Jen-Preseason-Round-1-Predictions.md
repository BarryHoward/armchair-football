1.  Andrew Crawford - L'eveon Bell (RB)
    Listen, we all know that this relationship didn't work out last year, but
    Andrew and Le'veon made a commitment to each other, and they're going to get
    through this together.

2.  Joe Labiosa - Pat Mahomes (QB)
    Joe literally started calling Mahomes "Mahomie" last season in a desperate
    trade attempt with Lynn. He won't let this one get away again.

3.  Jack Laing - Johnny Manziel (QB)
    In a protest against the Snake Draft, Jack will be only drafting AAF players.

4.  Ben Whitelaw - Detroit (DEF)
    The best offense is a defense, and Michigan Ben is going to snag the most
    middle-of-the road one. (Note that Dan would also have done this if he were  
    not drafting last)

5.  Jonathan Reed - Golden Tate (WR)
    A match made in the Meadowlands! It would be far too obvious of Jonathan to
    take Saquon.

6.  Alex Miller-Browne - Odell Beckham Jr  (WR)
    Alex will take Odell just so that Mike Smith gets annoyed that he rejected
    our offers to rejoin the league. His fault!

7.  Anthony Edwards - Zach Ertz (TE)
    This is the year for a first-round TE, and Anthony is just the guy bold enough
    to do it.

8.  Jen Strollo - Harrison Butker (K)
    I've been saying this for months, don't let this blindside you.

9.  Jeffrey Arredondo - Tevin Coleman (RB)
    If Jeff doesn't draft Tevin Coleman, Jen is going to make damn sure that he
    can never make a waiver claim for him, therefore, he's gotta be drafted.

10.  Alicia Blackburn - Tom Brady (QB)
    Alicia, a girl after my own heart, loves goats, therefore, she will be using 
    her round one pick on THE goat.

11.  Barry Howard - Michael Thomas (WR)
    Barry has been trying to convince us for a year now that he hates the New
    Orleans Saints. My theory is he's only doing that so we don't know that he
    wants their number one receiver in the first round.

12.  Danielle Garcia - DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
    Because she is WR1 on our flag football team, Danielle is taking this years
    top ranked wide receiver.

13.  Tim Azan - Ryan Fitzpatrick (QB)
    Tim said one time that he likes Miami so he's going to take their Fitzmagical
    QB.

14.  Dan Suciu - Saquon Barkley (RB)
    Dan is going to wonder how on earth Saquon dropped all the way down to him.
    He's just lucky to be here.
