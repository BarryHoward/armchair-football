# ATL Armchair Football League Constitution

In order to address concerns of rule-breaking, confusion regarding such, and the culture of distrust that has taken root in our previously harmonious fantasy football league, We the members of the ATL Armchair Football League do hereby establish this constitution as a necessary standard of order and as a reference in all future disputes, so help us God.

## Article I – League Charter

The fantasy football league was founded in 2017 as ATL Armchair Football League (ID# 117259) on Yahoo Fantasy Football.  It shall remain as such until transferred to another platform by unanimous vote by all active league members.  The rules of the league are determined by the commissioner and ratified by a majority vote by the members, so long as the number of teams does not exceed fourteen.

### Section 1 – League Entry

Entry to the league is contingent upon an empty spot being available with no other applicants.   If more than one applicant applies for the same league spot, active members of the league will decide which applicant best fits the desired characteristics for league membership.

### Section 2 - Fees

The entry fee for each season is $40 paid to the league treasurer (or commissioner if no league treasurer is appointed).  All fees should be paid prior to one week before the league draft.  Failure to provide the fee at the required time will result in forfeiture of a member’s reserved spot for the year, allowing for new applicants to apply for said members spot.

### Section 3 – Payouts

League payouts are as follows:

1. 1st Place – $300 and name inscribed into trophy.

2. 2nd Place - $80.

3. 3rd Place - $40.

4. Highest Point Scorer - $100.

League payouts may be changed by amending the constitution one week prior to the league draft.

### Section 4 – Trophies

Currently a winner’s trophy and a loser’s toilet bowl trophy have been purchased by the league to be given to the first and last place finishers for a season respectively.

The winner’s trophy will have the name of the winner, the winning team’s name, and the season year engraved at years end.  The winner may choose to keep the trophy on their desk for the following year or store it in a neutral location.  They MAY NOT take it home.

The loser’s toilet bowl trophy MUST be displayed on the loser’s desk until they finish a season not in last place, at which point the trophy is transferred to the new loser.  If a loser leaves the league while owning the loser’s toilet bowl trophy, they MUST keep the trophy until the end of the next season, at which point is transfers to the new loser.

### Section 5 – Constitution Amendments

Constitution amendments may be proposed by any league member, and can be added to the constitution with a 2/3 majority vote of active members.

### Section 6 – League Autonomy

The league functions irrespective of the General Electric organizational hierarchy.  Any punishments from the league are subject solely to the rules of this constitution as agreed upon by the league members.  Any attempt by members to use their positions at the company to influence the competitive balance of the league or escape its justice is strictly forbidden.

## Article 2 – League Rules

### Section 1 – Ghost Managing

Teams must be managed exclusively by their listed manager(s).  Allowing others to manage a team is strictly forbidden if they are not a listed co-manager regardless if they are in the league or not.  Multiple teams may not be managed or co-managed by the same person.  Co-managers must meet the same requirements of league members, though they do not have to actually be members.

In the event that a manager is unable to access their team, they may request that specific moves be made on their behalf by the commissioner or co-commissioners.  The request must be in the form of a written email to the entire league and give specific instructions as to which moves are to be made.  Move choices must be explicit and not left to the discretion of the person making the moves.  No advice is to be solicited, and there shall be no guarantee that the move will actually be made.

### Section 2 – Management Negligence

Teams must be continually managed throughout the season until said team is eliminated from playoff contention.  Failure to actively manage a team during this period may result in expulsion from the league after the season.

### Section 3 – Trades Vetoes

The commissioner may only temporarily cancel pending trades if he/she suspects collusion or if both trading parties agree to withdraw the trade.  If collusion is proven, the trade is cancelled permanently.  If collusion is suspected but not proven, the remaining members of the league must vote with a simple majority to uphold the veto, with any collusion punishments being applied if the veto is upheld.  If the vote fails, the trade will be reinitiated without commissioner interference.

### Section 4 – Trash Talk

All trash talk is permitted without official repercussion from the league.  This, however, does not protect league members from consequences of broken friendships or HR intervention.

### Section 5 – Collusion

Collusion is strictly prohibited and defined as follows:  Any actions designed to aid any team not managed by the party.  This includes, but is not limited to:

1. Attempting negative trades with a preferred team when out of contention (Trade Tanking)

2. Dropping quality players with the intention that they are picked up by a preferred team when out of contention (Drop Tanking)

3. Attempting negative trades with a team playing against a competing team with the intention of helping them to win for the week (Loaning)

4. Managing more than one team (Ghost Managing if the manager has their own team)

Any proven cases of collusion may result in the IMMEDIATE expulsion of both parties.
