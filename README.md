    Welcome "Friends"

## Introduction

Welcome to the ATL Armchair Football League, a high-drama league filled with GE co-workers that were tired of getting along with each other.  Here, managers compete for glory or to avoid embarrassment, while pretending to quit when they lose, because that one rule they wanted didn't pass 6 months ago.  Expect the same wild accusations, duplicitous scheming, and violent threats that accompany most competitive/gambling endeavors.

## A Word from our Current Champion

Your champion Alex has forsaken you, as she refuses to add a decree to the page.  Therefore, this lovely picture will remain in place until she decides that she loves you again.
