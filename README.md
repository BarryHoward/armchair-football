    Hello There.
</p>

Welcome to the ATL Armchair Football League.  The league is open to anyone who works at the GE Buckhead office, so if you're interested in joining, we will most likely have a few open spots for 2019, so please Commissioner Jonathan know.

**However, as decreed by God-Emperor Barry, this is a league for winners, where the fires of competition forge champions.  It is not for the weak, as they will be preyed upon to service the alphas.  You have been warned.**

    This is the face of winning.  Deal with it.
